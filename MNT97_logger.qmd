# Documentation

**Initial setup**: On August 17, 1999, a Campbell CR10x data logger was installed in the LTER Toolik Moist Non-acidic Tussock Experimental plots (MNT97) block 2 to monitor air temperature, relative humidity, and soil temperatures. Sensors in the control and greenhouse plots (not in the greenhouse NP) include: air temperature and relative humidity. These sensors are read every minute and averaged or totaled every hour. The greenhouse air temperature and RH sensor were not added until June 15, 2000. The covers on greenhouses are removed every fall and reinstalled every spring.

Two profiles of soil temperature are measured per treatment plot with copper/constantan thermocouple wires (TC) installed at depths of 0,10, 20, and 40 cm in inter-tussock areas. All soil temperature sensors are on a Campbell Sci. AM416 multiplexer. The following label codes are used: CT = control, GH = greenhouses, NP = fertilized, GHF = greenhouse fertilized, plus a 1 or a 2 for the profile number. All soil sensors are read every 15 minutes and averaged every 3 hours.

**Sensor Description**:

-   RELATIVE HUMIDITY/TEMPERATURE: Campbell Scientific, CS500 Temperature and Relative Humidity Probe. Uses PRT for temperature measurement; capacitive RH chip for RH. Accuracy is ±3% over 10-90% RH; ±6% over 90-100% RH. Manufactured by Vaisala, Inc.

-   THERMOCOUPLES: Omega Engineering, Copper-Constantan wire. Range -200 to 350 °C. Limits of error: Standard wire 1.0°C or 0.75% above 0°C and 1.0°C or 1.5% below 0°C. Special wire 0.5°C or 0.4%.

**Log of Changes**

2007-04-28 Downloaded the storage module. Wires were chewed, and the logger lost power. Restored connection, but greenhouse Temp/RH still not working.\
2007-10-19 Added a subroutine to use Steinhart-Hart equation for reference temperature.\
2008-06-08 Fixed GH Temp/RH sensor.\
2009-06-11 Battery problem. The logger was only powered when the solar panel was providing power. Greenhouse temperature was -40; not sure why. Maybe start of Sic Sic nest in the battery box. Sic Sic made a nest in the battery box and chewed lots of wires.\
2009-08-11 Repaired battery wire.\
2009-08-13 Looks like the GH temp/RH went out\
2011-08-07 GH Temp/RH were reinstalled\
2011-10-06 Took out the hour on the final storage for daily.\
2014-08-10 Added radio control since switched the radio to a Freeway FGR115 serial number 9178094. Added program signature and reference temperatures -both subroutine and P11 values\
