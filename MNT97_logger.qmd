**Initial setup**: On August 17, 1999, a Campbell CR10x data logger with an AM416 multiplexer was installed in the LTER Toolik Moist Non-acidic Tussock Experimental plots (MNT97) block 2 to monitor air temperature and relative humidity in the control and greenhouse control (added June 15, 2000) and soil temperatures. Soil temperatures are measured with two profiles of copper/constantan thermocouple wires (TC) per treatment plot, installed at depths of 0, 10, 20, and 40 cm in inter-tussock areas.

Temperature and relative humidity are read every minute and averaged every hour, while the soil sensors are read every 15 minutes and averaged every 3 hours. The following label codes are used: CT = control, GH = greenhouses, NP = fertilized, GHF = greenhouse fertilized, plus a 1 or a 2 for the soil profile number. Note that the covers on greenhouses are removed every fall and reinstalled every spring.

Plots were set up in July 1997. Three replicate blocks were established with the following annual treatments in 5 x 20 m plots: control (CT), nitrogen added (N), phosphorus added (P), and nitrogen combined with phosphorus (NP). The fertilized treatment rate was 10 g/m2 Nitrogen (as NH4NO3) and 5 g/m2 Phosphorus (as triple superphosphate). Two replicate blocks were established with a greenhouse treatment (GH) and a greenhouse fertilized treatment (GHNP).

In 2012, the nitrogen was switched to 5 grams ammonium chlorite and 5 grams Sodium nitrate due to the unavailability of NH4NO3 fertilizer.

In 2023, treatments were discontinued.

**Sensor Description**:

-   RELATIVE HUMIDITY/TEMPERATURE: Campbell Scientific, CS500 Temperature and Relative Humidity Probe. Uses PRT for temperature measurement; capacitive RH chip for RH. Accuracy is ±3% over 10-90% RH; ±6% over 90-100% RH. Manufactured by Vaisala, Inc.

-   THERMOCOUPLES: Omega Engineering, Copper-Constantan wire. Range -200 to 350 °C. Limits of error: Standard wire 1.0°C or 0.75% above 0°C and 1.0°C or 1.5% below 0°C. Special wire 0.5°C or 0.4%.

**Log of Changes**

2004-06-04 Replaced CT Temperature RH probe.\
2005-06-12 Soil TC probe check. CT-E up 4 cm, NP w up 3 cm, GH e p 15 cm, GHW up 9 cm, others OK.\
2005-08-05 Soil TC probe check. CT E up 8\*, CT W up 3, NP E up 5 cm, NP E up 5, GH N up 6\*, GHS up 5, GHF E up 13\*, GHF W up 13\*. \* Reset to correct depth. Instead of a fiberglass pole, I used a plastic flag stake to put TCs at the correct depths.\
2006-06-10 Battery wire corroded. Data lost. Cleaned and repaired the wire. Repaired the NP TC wire where an animal chewed it. Reset the time since it was off by 30 minutes.\
2006-08-15 Soil TC check. NP up 3 to 5 cm, CT1 up 2 cm; reset, GH up 2 cm, GHNP_40 cm up 5 to 7 cm, GHNP all others on flag stakes are OK.\
2007-04-28 Downloaded the storage module. Wires were chewed, and the logger lost power. Restored connection, but greenhouse Temp/RH still not working.\
2007-10-19 Added a subroutine to use the Steinhart-Hart equation for reference temperature.\
2008-06-08 Fixed GH Temp/RH sensor.\
2009-06-11 Battery problem. The logger was only powered when the solar panel was providing power. Greenhouse temperature was -40; not sure why. Maybe start of Sic Sic nest in the battery box. Sic Sic made a nest in the battery box and chewed lots of wires.\
2009-08-11 Repaired battery wire.\
2009-08-13 Looks like the GH temp/RH went out\
2011-08-07 GH Temp/RH were reinstalled\
2011-10-06 Took out the hour on the final storage for daily.\
2012-08-16 Soil TC check GH on flag up 2 to 10 cm\
2014-08-10 Added radio control since switched the radio to a Freeway FGR115 serial number 9178094. Added program signature and reference temperatures -both subroutine and P11 values\
