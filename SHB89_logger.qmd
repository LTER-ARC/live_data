# Documentation

**Initial setup.**

Experiment plots were set up in 1989 in a randomized block design (5-meter by 10-meter plots) with the following treatments:

CT - Control untreated plot. NP - 10 gm N per meter squared of 34 - 0 - 0 nitrogen fertilizer (34% ammonium nitrate ) plus 5 P gm per meter squared of 0 - 45 - 0 fertilizer (45% P as P2O5). N - 10 gm N per meter squared of 34 - 0 - 0 nitrogen fertilizer (34% ammonium nitrate ) only. P - 5 P gm per meter squared of 0 - 45 - 0 fertilizer (45% P as P2O5)only. GH - Warming treatment using a simple 2.4 m x 4.9 m wood frame covered by commercial greenhouse plastic. GHNP - Warming with NP treatment. SH - Shading experiment using a 2.4 m x 4.9 m wood frame covered by 50% shade cloth.

**Log of Changes**

**1998-08-14**, a CR10 logger, serial no. 16942, with an AM416 multiplier was set up in block 2 to measure soil temperatures using custom type T thermocouples.

Two profiles of soil temperature are measured per treatment plot with custom copper/constantin thermocouple wires (TC) installed at depths of \~ 1 (labeled moss), 10, 20, and 40. The following label codes are used: CT = control, GH = greenhouses, SH = shade houses, NP = fertilized, GHNP = greenhouse fertilized, plus a 1 or a 2 for the profile number. All soil sensors are read every 15 minutes and averaged every 3 hours. In CT, there are additional depths of 5 and 100 cm

**2001-06-19** Soil moisture probes were installed in an untreated area approximately 2 meters from the data logger using Campbell Scientific CS615s and a Trime -EZ TDR probe placed \~ 5-10 cm in the organic layer. The Trime was problematic since it draws a significant wattage. It is programmed to switch off during the winter. For the CS615 probes, a correction is applied based on a calibration curve developed from comparing the probe readings to the field gravimetric. The equation y = 0.60x + 7.68 has an R² of 0.86 (where y is the corrected value and x is the sensor value in % volume H₂O to volume of soil, i.e., meter cubed water per meter cubed soil, multiplied by 100).\
The Trime-EZ output is volts, which is then converted using the calibration equation of y =*0.1*2.022\*x-1.396 (where y is the corrected value and x is the sensor value in volts).

**2007-08-10** Added an if statement to correct reference temperatures below -28 °C with a polynomial derived from the resistance and temperature data table using only the temperatures below -28 °C. See Campbell Sci. 107 manual. Changed output to include year.\
**2009-06-09** Put the Trime back on.\
**2009-08-09** Added 109 sensor for air temperature. Moved the soil temperature statements to table 2 and the 109 using the Steinhart-Hart equation. Note that two subroutines are needed since the 109 and 107 have different thermistors. Added control port 6 control on powering the Trime soil moisture sensor. It should be off during the winter.

**2013-06-13**. Added CR1000 (serial no. 33711) with HMP50 temperature/Rh sensor and LiCor LI-190 quantum sensors to measure temperature and PAR in GH, SH, and CT.

**2013-08-10**. Added in BF3 PAR and diffuse PAR sensor. Disconnected the T109 since adding BF3 left no room.

**2014-08-09** Took out CR10x logger and now just using a CR1000 serial number 43615. Two AM25T measure Soil TC, and an AM416 measures soil moisture.\
GH2 AND GHF2 temperature profiles were switched, correcting the program and in Excel files.
