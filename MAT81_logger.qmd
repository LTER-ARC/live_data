In 2015, CS 616 soil moisture and 107 temperature sensors were installed in Block 3 Control and NP plots, along the western long edge, approximately 1 meter into the plots at 10 and 20 cm depths. Air temperature and relative humidity at 3 meters are also measured. A Campbell Scientific CR1000 with an AM416 multiplexer is used to measure the sensors. A FreeWave FGR-115RC, serial 9116010, radio modem provides wireless connectivity.

Nitrogen and phosphorus treatment was discontinued in 2015. These sensors were installed to monitor the post-treatment phase. For plot setup, see:
