    "text": "Initial setup.\nExperiment plots setup:\nIn 1989, in a randomized block design (5-meter by 10-meter plots) with the following treatments:\nCT - Control untreated plot. NP - 10 gm N per meter squared of 34 - 0 - 0 nitrogen fertilizer (34% ammonium nitrate ) plus 5 P gm per meter squared of 0 - 45 - 0 fertilizer (45% P as P2O5). N - 10 gm N per meter squared of 34 - 0 - 0 nitrogen fertilizer (34% ammonium nitrate ) only. P - 5 P gm per meter squared of 0 - 45 - 0 fertilizer (45% P as P2O5)only. GH - Warming treatment using a simple 2.4 m x 4.9 m wood frame covered by commercial greenhouse plastic. GHNP - Warming with NP treatment. SH - Shading experiment using a 2.4 m x 4.9 m wood frame covered by 50% shade cloth.\nLogger setup:\nIn June 1994, a data logger and sensors for weather and soil temperatures were installed in block 1. Air temperature and relative humidity at 3 meters and soil temperatures at surface, 10, and 25 cm depths are collected on the following treatment plots: control, nitrogen alone, phosphorus alone, nitrogen plus phosphorus, and greenhouse. Air temperature and relative humidity are read every minute and averaged every hour, while soil temperatures are read every 3 minutes and averaged every 4 hours. The shade and greenhouse covers are only installed from June through August.\nNotes\nShade and greenhouses are not covered year-round. They are covered in early June and uncovered in mid-August. The sensors are up year-round.\nWhen the air temperature drops below -39 Celsius, the “CT Air 107” probe is used to replace the “CT Air Temp” value.\nOccasional erratic soil temperature values occur when the air temperature is below -30. This is caused by inaccurate reference temperature at temperatures below -30. Values have not been corrected.\nLog of Changes\nDuring the winter of 1994-1995, a program error caused the data from 20Aug94 to 28Mar95 to be lost. Data was also lost during winter 1995-1996.\n1996 - Relative humidity is low, never reaching above 90%. Data were not corrected. RH sensor replaced summer of 1996.\n1999 18 Aug Changed out the 207 temp/RH sensor, replacing it with a CS500. Since the CS500 only goes to -39 °C, the 207 is used to measure the temperatures below -40 °C and as a backup. Note that the 207 measurement error below -40 °C is large. See Campbell’s manual on the 207/107. The 207 was discontinued since the RH sensor is no longer available.\n2001 Added a subroutine to calculate the reference and air 107 temperature probes using a Steinhart-Hart equation: The voltage of a 107 probe is converted to resistance then converted to both Kelvin and Celsius using 1/T= A + B ln Rs + C(lnRs)^3 where T = Kelvin and A, B, and C are constants derived from the temperature vs resistance data of the Fenwell thermistors. Rs is the measured resistance. This will improve the accuracy of temperatures below -30–30C. The station lost power. Using a regression with Toolik Field Station Air 5 meters to estimate the CT Air Temp\n2000 Station lost power from 2000-08-19 13:00 to 2000-08-22 16:00. Using a regression with Toolik Field Station Air 5 meters to estimate the “CT Air Temp”.\n2002 The control relative humidity sensor stopped working. Not sure why.\n2003 The data logger stopped collecting data from Feb through May. The temperature and RH sensors failed from May to August due to a faulty splice in the cable. The 3 meter temperature was not replaced until June 2004\n2004 The 3 meter temperature/RH probe replace June with the same model - CS500\n2011 Lost power from 4Aug to 6Aug caused by a corroded battery wire. 2012 Replace 207 with a 107 Thermistor. The old 207 cable was cracking. The 107 is in the same shield as the CS500.\n2014-03-21 Changed soil output to every hour with reads every 120 sec. Seeing if this will give smoother temperature values. Jim L\n2015 Jan added panel temperature average to output. Trying to see if this is causing jumpy soil temps. Jim L\n2015 May Corrected the coefficients on the Steinhart equation. The thermistor is a newer one (Belatherm 100k6A). Jim L\n2015 Aug Redid the subroutine for calculating the Steinhart Hart equation based on the Campbells Scientific’s 109 manual. Using a half bridge to read the 107 See notes in Sub 3 Changed the soil to 3 hour averages. Jim L\n2019 Aug Changed logger to a CR23XPB. It now usees the PakBus radio Network and will have room for more soil temperature probes. Jim L\nEquipment Description:\nList of manufacturers and suppliers.\nCampbell Scientific Inc. 81 W. 1800 N.
